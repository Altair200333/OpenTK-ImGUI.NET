# OpenTK + ImGUI.Net
 
Small C# engine working on OpenGL(provoded by OpenTK) and ImGUI.Net library(solution on linking it with opentTK was found [here](https://github.com/NogginBops/ImGui.NET_OpenTK_Sample). To manage components i used simple ECS. 
Also it can import stl models and place them in 3d space.
